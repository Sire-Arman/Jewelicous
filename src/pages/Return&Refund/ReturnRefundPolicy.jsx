          </p>
          <p>1. Initiate your return.</p>
          <p>
            2. If returning within 15 days, a free FedEx / UPS /DHL /Blue Dart
            shipping label will be emailed to you once you have initiated your
            return.
          </p>

            3. Package your item(s) securely in the original packing materials.
          </p>

            diamond grading reports or appraisal(s). Diamond grading reports and
            appraisals are not required for repairs and resize. If your item was

            business days to post the funds to your account. Bank wire refunds
            of Rs. 50000 or greater typically take 7 to 10 business days after
